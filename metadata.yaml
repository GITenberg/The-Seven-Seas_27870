description: A contemporary New York Times review of this 1896 collection of poetry
  praised Kipling's immense rhythmic power. ... His preliminaries are always brief,
  but in the attack he carries all before him. The book includes the poems, "The first
  chantey," "To the true romance," and "Sestina of the tramp-royal," as well as a
  few of Kipling's famous Barrack-Room Ballads."
